# MineSweeper
Mine Sweeper written on C#

  I'm glad to introduce one of my first fun projects. 
  It's a very known game Mine Sweeper, I've created on my own being inspired by posobilty creating games on C#. 
Constraction of this program it's not really complicated, I've used my bacis knowleadge of C# and some grafics
features of WPF C#(Windows Presentation Foundation) witch I googled in Internet. 
   By making this my first step in Game Development, I hope to become a Professional Game Developer :)
